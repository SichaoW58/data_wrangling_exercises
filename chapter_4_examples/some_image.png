we wanted to tell you about the new policies well before they go into  
effect on June 1, 2021. Below is a summary of the new policies. Please

for a complete list of what's changing.


Summary of the new policies (effective June 1, 2021):

- If you're  
inactive<https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AD-FnEyIcVzNJyh96X4LHdkqvFsIUw8B3IFZQBcifuHZOvja5SDA2G1JblPKwr_qD_H6wEGHi7Jvo1bmNQIA0qih184SDAQcqJE_aiVHJiirkSJfg_8q74bpWSPu6uwazF0l3ZtGUe12hz8NFA>  
for 2 years (24 months) in Gmail, Drive or Photos, we may delete the  
content in the product(s) in which you're inactive. Google  
One<https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AD-FnEynRaypM8BfuJd_j9qAlL4CCAmdLFAjXEinVtY6nw19jwuWs98JeWqJKgVnaWax2QfuVaZBY4U0KYnaswpFlb8xwE_mp_9ELgc2Ay6yOESXkfTCNxRqrac73JJVTTGZZj_M5-DX85kSseJryS8oGSKi9gPakQ>  
members who are within their storage quota and in  
good-standing<https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AD-FnEx9nD3w_PCoVTWprup78bQnD9M49csbwl-7lgTTyIzn7CpMKutCWfCJaQ-7N7lzf_W3bJQTJQixQ42sLCM62lanE1D90wreEriZf4eBrDF1rhQHT_CCW6_GP53gWK-1EY5cDLA>  
will not be impacted by this new inactive policy.


- If you exceed your storage limit for 2 years, we may delete your content  
across Gmail, Drive and Photos.

What this means for you:

- You won't be impacted by these changes unless you've been inactive or  
over your storage limit for 2 years. As this policy goes into effect June  
1, 2021, the earliest it would be enforced is June 1, 2023.

- After June 1, 2021, if you are either inactive or over your storage  
limit, we will send you email reminders and notifications in advance and  
prior to deleting any content.

- Even if you are either inactive or over your storage limit for one or  
more of these services and content is deleted, you will still be able to  
sign in.

- Note: The inactivity and over quota storage policies will apply only to  
consumer users of Google services. Google Workspace, G Suite for Education  
and G Suite for Nonprofits policies are not changing at this time, and  
admins should look to the Admin Help  
center<https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AD-FnEzuqqRrLukd6wYzenFkey4x--cGIWHOBuOr8GbkhwpzvmEtSjhJC_KO4TIuezYVW0l-DBXGb9_b__iOHptUhaYeNOJBBT710uniEXBgbi2Xmnf03bK53iSCa4AtFrk>  
for storage policies related to their subscriptions.
